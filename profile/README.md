_Desig Protocol is a blockchain-agnostic (smartcontractless) multisig solution._

## What is Multisig?

Multisig (or Multi-signature) refers to a shared wallet that requires multiple keys to authorize a transaction. A t-out-of-n multisig wallet needs t signatures at least to consent and process a transaction.

1. **No key-person Risk.** Key person risk refers to when a company relies almost entirely on a single individual to succeed.
2. **Greater Transparency.** Transaction policies, signers and actual transactions are all made publicly available on chain or in the code.
3. **Buildable Smart-Wallet.** It can be easily adjusted or upgraded to fit the needs of an institution or DAO.

## What's wrong with the current solutions?

Smartcontract is the bottle neck.

Currently, $1.8bil is being locked in unscalable multisig infrastructures. The majority of multisig solutions are using smartcontracts to implement multisig logic. Concretely, the smartcontract must need to know how to encode the transactions, and these integrations must heavily rely on developer knowledge. As a result, it is ad-hoc, time-consuming, and unscalable.

## What are we doing? What is Desig?

We want to use the technique of threshold signature to solve the problem. The process of signing now is no longer operated by a smartcontract. Instead, signers can communicate directly with each other and combine the signature by multi-party computation in a trustless setup.

_Desig Protocol is a blockchain-agnostic (smartcontractless) multisig solution._

## What is Multisig?

Multisig (or Multi-signature) refers to a shared wallet that requires multiple keys to authorize a transaction. A t-out-of-n multisig wallet needs t signatures at least to consent and process a transaction.

1. **No key-person Risk.** Key person risk refers to when a company relies almost entirely on a single individual to succeed.
2. **Greater Transparency.** Transaction policies, signers and actual transactions are all made publicly available on chain or in the code.
3. **Buildable Smart-Wallet.** It can be easily adjusted or upgraded to fit the needs of an institution or DAO.

## What are we doing?

We want to use the technique of threshold signature to solve the problem. The process of signing now is no longer operated by a smartcontract. Instead, signers can communicate directly with each other and combine the signature by multi-party computation in an untrusted setup.
